# Student Placement Prediction

A simple web application that predicts whether a student will be placed based on their **CGPA** and **IQ** using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features
- Input fields for **CGPA** and **IQ**.
- Displays "Placed" or "Not Placed" dynamically below the IQ field without reloading the page.
- Responsive design for all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) loaded using `pickle`.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohitbedse/Placement-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-placement-prediction
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask numpy
   ```
4. Place the trained `model.pkl` file in the project folder.
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py OR flask run
   ```
6. Open in your browser:
   ```

   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add more features like additional input fields (e.g., extracurricular activities).
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform.
